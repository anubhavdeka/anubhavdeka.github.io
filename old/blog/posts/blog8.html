			<p class="center-align">i do not know about you, but if you are anything like me, there are some moments in your childhood that are seared into your memory. vivid memories that are deeply ingrained into your mind and although they are not exactly what keeps you up at night. moments during the day, songs, poems and prose, video games, movies, they all trigger a chain reaction in your head and then you arrive at those memories, and more often than not, you are filled with this fuzzy, warm, happy glow.</p>

			<p class="center-align">i recently experienced this with Life is Strange : Before The Storm, and although I have played both the titles in the series, Before The Storm has left me reminiscing a day in my childhood, which for some unexplainable reason I carry around with me. call it my "happy place", if you will. The entire game, with it's gorgeous soundtrack, it's corny but memorable dialog, the fall setting of both the main titles, the innocence of the characters and the bittersweet memories of their childhood, it all resonates with me on a spiritual level. </p>

			<p class="center-align">when i was a kid, i had a calendar that had the most gorgeous photo for each month. i remember each of the photos vividly. january had a village straight out of a fairytale snowed in at dawn, august had a gorgeous steam engine billowing smoke and racing into the rain, but, september had the photo that probably kickstarted my obsession with the fall season, warm colors,  my obsession to be alone (kind of ironic that i am even writing this, with that in mind) and my love for photos and videos. it had a lonely oak by a lake and it was ablaze with the colors of fall. the ground around it seemed like it was set on fire, and you could feel the stillness of the air in that single photo. needless to say, it left a mark on seven year old me and i still carry that moment when i first saw the photograph. </p>

			<p class="center-align">coming back to LiS, maybe the fall setting and the music convey a mood that i did not have the words to express it back then, an environment that i yearn for and even though i have never been to any place like that, i feel like the place keeps calling out to me. the solitude, and the beauty of the nature in the photograph call out to me and even if it sounds very childish, i would love to actually go to the place once in my lifetime.</p>
