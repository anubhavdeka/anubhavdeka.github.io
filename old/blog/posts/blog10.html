			<p class="center-align">how do you base, or more accurately, "measure" your relationships with other people on a scale of absolute mess to glorious harmony?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">was that a bit too vague?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">let me explain myself a bit more, then.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">we all have a yardstick to measure ourselves, e.g., some of us equate possessing more material things as being successful, some of us think settling down and having kids as the "correct" thing to do in life, while some of us measure success as the amount of alcohol we can down without throwing up, and then some of us measure success by the number of cats that we can pet in a day (my personal record is 6).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">so, my question is, what do you choose to measure yourself? how do you define success and failure in life? in your personal and business ventures? how do you define what kind of a person you are? and i am not talking about cookie cutter responses too, i am asking why as well. sure, you might have some yardstick to define yourself by, but why do you define yourself by that metric? is it because you were brought up being told that "x" is something that you should do, otherwise you are a monster and unfit for human civilization, or is it something that you picked up on your own volition because it felt right?</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">christ, that took a turn.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">if you are still confused, let me use myself as an example. i recently realized that i "base" (for lack of a better term), the "success" of my relationships with my friends and loved ones by how much we talk, or more correctly in the age of tech, text. although i have to explain, i don't expect people to keep pinging me up nonstop, what i meant was the "quality" of communication, not the "quantity" of communication. i know i sound extremely entitled, but hear me out. communication to me is key, because not only am i <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_jWHffIx5E" target="_blank"><i> not </i> the sharpest tool in the shed</a>, i do not particularly excel in expressing myself as well (i am working on it though). i have recently begun to identify all my problems as a human being, both mental and physical, and even if i am trying to better myself, every now and then, i need some sort of, hmmm, how do i put this, some sort of "boost", to keep doing this. i know that it is not a very healthy way to measure yourself or your relationship with others but i do not have much else to go on as well.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">while this seems like a very mundane and easily met criteria, it is insanely hard for me to do so, because people lie a lot, and i have a knack of picking up people in order to "fix" them. this "fixer" mentality of mine has almost never helped me in any form, and even made me lose people that i would probably would not have lost (as my close friends know, i am not a big fan of leaving people behind). the larger problem is that i tend to hold myself accountable for the actions of others. and that is the other shoe drops. i tend to talk said people out of their "predicament" and while i might be knowing that they have chosen this "predicament", the delusion is so strong, many times i refuse to believe the truth, and instead focus on the worst that could happen and i mean the absolute worst thing possible in said circumstance.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">and that is why i value quality communication over most other things in a relationship. (probably not the best person to be saying this too)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">i am a hypocrite in this sense. i like to think i am very private and i keep a close knit circle, but then i also write this, for everyone to see, if they are even reading this, in the first place.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section"></div>
				<div class="col s6">
					<p class="center-align">in short, this is what i base the success of my relationships upon.</p>

		<div class="section"></div>
		<div class="col s6">
			<p class="center-align">it is much more nuanced than i can properly express in this blogpost, and maybe, if we ever meet, we can discuss it in a much more meaningful conversation.</p>
