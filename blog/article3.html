      indie chill. that's my favourite genre right about now. a bit of useless information about me. it is 9 in the pm and it feels good to have completed all your work for the day. today i felt very out of league, as always. preparing for an amazing summer is a lot of work in and of itself. why, you ask? because i am tired of being mediocre. mediocre in any and all fields i ever attempt to ventur in. sorry for being a depressed pos but i am just not in the mood to do anything more than lie up in my bed curl up under the sheets. it's been a depressing fucking week man. i just cleaned almost my entire instagram page. another useless piece of information about me.

      in other news, i got a new phone as of today. it's pretty nice and fast and shit like that and i spent almost the entire day making junk on it.

      if you are reading this, i wanted to ask you another thing, do you think video games are a waste of time? a few months back, a friend of mine just basically said this to me, "video games are a complete waste, it just eats up so much time. why do you play games so much?", well, i don't know man. this firend is more accomplished than me in key areas like coding and everything science related. the other friend who said the exact same thing is also the same in his own field. so i ask, do you feel like it is a waste of time? if so, why? because i never had a dull moment with them? do you think you can boost your performance if you stopped doing this completely? i mean, if i curb it, will i get stability and focus in life? what do you think?
