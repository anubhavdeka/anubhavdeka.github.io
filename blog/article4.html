        i have been gainig a lot of weight these past few days, even after restricting myself from a lot of sugary delights and a lot of other, let's say, intoxicating shit. hi there, as you may know by now, my name is anubhav deka and i am 20 years old. i am not particular;y useful in any citeria and i do not have any special skills to write home about. nice to make your acquaintaince. 
       <br><br>
       i had been moping a lot the past few entries so i have decided not to bore you guys, if any of you are reading this, that is, that i have decided to stop moping around and focus on my work.
       <br><br>
       starting off, let's talk abut tech. tech as in hw for now, not sw. the last few weeks have been pretty fucking amazing in this department. i picked up a lot of hw specific related sw knowledge, and i am currently stress testing the hell out of my raspberry that i "borrowed". the thing is pretty damn amazing. i am yet to unlock it's full potential and it rocks even now. i plan to make it a hub on the IoT project i have been working on since the last few months and i plan to underclock it and undervolt the GPIO pins to control the LEDs and the arduinos. trust me when i say this, the arduinos maybe very extensible but hot damn the pi is so easy to work with.
       <br><br>
       as i am typing this in the middle of my classroom, i have 8 man pages open and i cannot make head or tail out of the current dilemma of, in layman terms, calibrating the torque provided the motors that i have hooked up to my curtains to make the go, "WHOOSH!" all on their own, because i am lazy.
       <br><br>
       i was also looking into, still in layman's terms, how to make a wired set of speakers, wireless with security and some primitive sort of authenticating sw to approve my devices so that i don't have porn playng on them at 8k watts from my brother's cellphone (dude , i know). as i was saying, it is not extremly hard but it is quite a pain in the ass to properly set up a oauth system and a 5 band eq 
       on a small littl board.
       <br><br><br><br>
       that's life i guess.
