      "the universe has a strange sense of humour", that's the name of the song currently warbling out of my tinny speakers. it's three forty five right now and the high is slowly wearing off. i'm sorry, i'm rambling on without stating any purpose. this is my blog. i don't maintain it, nor do i update it. but this time it is going to be different. i will try to keep an hour daily for it. not because i am the best writer around, but i need to brush up on my git skills because i also am not the sharpest developer around these parts. this will be a diary of sorts. anyways, back to my ramblings. it's three forty seven right now in the morning, and this is essentially me talking to myself but i feel like i have become some sort of a cog in the machine. mornings are dull, the days are dull and i find myself constantly comparing with people who have more than me, atleast on social media. i see my life and the possible future it is starting to take shape and i just cannot get my ass off the chair to work for something. it just feels like, the fire has died out in me. i don't know if this is depression or just me being lazy, but life sucks right now. i am too tired to ask for help or to just reach out anymore. it sucks to be me right now. ofcourse i have all the material need i could possibly want right now, but the void in me is getting indescribably big and i don't know how to fill it in. 
      <br><br>
      this is pretty depressing to read, so let's just switch topics for now.
      <br><br>
      i am currently working on a IoT project and it has started taking some structure and the basic arduinos are working properly for now. i absolutely did not anticipate that it will be so freaking hard but damn, i am legitimately getting my mind pummeled to dirt. it's absolutely not easy to explain to a plank of silicon that my phone getting connected to the wifi does mean i am near my room(my phone is always with me so yes it does mean that i am near). but it has been so rewarding, i never knew how to memory manage up until this point of time ( told you i am not the greatest developer) and i have some idea right now. i try to write minimal code, because minimal is beautiful(read, "less work"). all that is left is to buy some camreas that i can program face detection in and some motors to automate my curtains, and i'll be done.
      <br><br>
      it's four twenty in the morning, my cat woke up and ran outside, lullabyebye is gently wafting from my old school speakers, the high has worn off and it's time i go for a run. see you guys tomorrow.
