				Photos mean so much to me. I have only recently started getting back into the photography these past few years and they have been so liberating. It starts deep inside the inner recess of my mind that I have not completely yet understood myself, and  that evolves into an idea. An idea that completely consumes me, I lay awake thinking about it, the nuances, the mood, the feel, the emotions, the vibes, the music in my head, everything starts to revolve and take shape around it. It completely consumes from within and till the moment I don’t get it out from my system and onto something else. It’s an intensely burning passion that plants deep into my mind, evolves into all consuming fire and makes me fidget endlessly. What writing is to you, taking photos is for me. It’s a way to make me be someone else, someone that is not bound by rules or some chains. It may sound selfish and I definitely know about it, but is one of the few thing in my life that I  can call purely and wholly mine.</p>

				<p class="center-align">Inspiration for me lies everywhere. The crisp morning air, the sultry summer afternoons, the blazing sun, the soft winter wind. A young couple walking in the evening, in fights and in love-filled moments. The way the bees caress the flowers in my mom’s garden. The smell of cooking early in the morning, the soft laugh of a baby. The deep thumping bass of a concert, the crashing cymbals and the strain of the singer’s voice. Old songs on scratched up cassettes owned by my friends, the crackling of the radio, the steady hum of rain in the monsoon, the youthful sparkle in an old person’s eyes, the sadness of leaving behind a loved one or the heartbreaking feeling. The soft river breeze on summer afternoons, the afternoons we spent together and laughed together. Those hazy memories from my childhood with my bestfriend, Ninad. The lies, the truths, the emotions, the tears, the heart-wrenching emptiness. Everything is so beautiful, so pure and so strong.</p>

				As you can probably guess, the entire process of taking photos is not a simple press of a button for me, it is nearly a spiritual experience, and for better or for worse, I would not have it otherwise.

				I am not very good at taking photos and I understand the underlying irony that I am even writing this piece when I have not yet put out any significant work, but I felt the same while I was toying with the idea of writing this piece down. It made me grow restless by the minute, before I finally penned it down. And this is what you see now.
