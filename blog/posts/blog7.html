			<p class="center-align">loss is a strange feeling, and yet, i have always felt strangely comforted by the idea of loss. i do not know why i felt like this, but it always seemed that the feeling of loss was always present in my life. right from the my earliest memories to now.</p>
			<div class="section"></div>
			<p class="center-align">i have never been really afraid of losing anyone or anything up until this year. maybe it is because i have changed so much in such a short period, or the fact that i have been never in tune with who i was in the first place itself. or maybe because i lived in a bubble of safety of my own making or maybe because i simply did not care about anything. but i digress. it's such a foreign feeling for me, it's like i have discovered a whole new world that was hidden from my fingertips all this time.</p>
			<div class="section"></div>
			<p class="center-align">loss. such a short, small word with so much power behind it. power to wage wars, end lives, start new ones, end love and start love as well. form friendships and break blood bonds.</p>
			<div class="section"></div>
			<p class="center-align">no wonder i was so oblivious to this.</p>
			<div class = "section"></div>
			<p class="center-align">as i probe deeper and deeper into myself as a person, i realize that i tend to hide from my problems, and maybe this is why i always avoided any actions that would let me lose anyone or anything in my life, if you may, i had become a hoarder of sorts. a hoarder of people, secrets and lies. a hoarder of unexpressed feelings and pent up anger. maybe these are the reasons that explain why i am so afraid of opening up in any capacity to anyone in my life. </p>
			<div class="section"></div>
			<p class="center-align">i was almost certain that i would have lost a person so close to my heart today, that, for the first time in my life, i could feel my eyes welling up. i have now realized, that i have an immensely intense emotional <i> kick </i> when it concerns my family and friends. </p>
			<div class="section"></div>
			<p class="center-align">maybe this is what the fear of loss is.</p>

			<p class="center-align">maybe this is what gives life meaning.</p>
