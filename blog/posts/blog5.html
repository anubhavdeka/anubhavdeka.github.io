			<p class="center-align">a lot of things has happened in the course of the last few months. i ran my first 22k. i cut off a lot of people i realized i did not. i made a lot of amazing friends as well, people i can count on with my eyes closed. i finally finally picked up a couple of books i always wanted to read and i also started a lot of new projects too. i finally started learning web development a bit seriously now and mobile development too. i have always been not very into these fields, but i think it's time to finally dive into them. i have never been a good person at expressing how i feel, so i have been working on that as well. so far, it has been going pretty well.</p>

			<div class="section"></div>

			<p class="center-align">therapy has been rather helpful for me, helping me deal with a myriad of mental problems i have. i only recently learned that what i keep feeling ninety-nine percent of the time is called the "imposter syndrome". this feeling has been haunting me for the entirety of my life, as far back as i can remember. it has stopped me from a lot of opportunities. but life goes on, doesn't it? now, i can put my best foot forward.</p>

			<div class="section"></div>

			<p class="center-align">i discovered that i had stage 3 cancer. while this came out of the left field because i have never mistreated my body as such but i can't say that i am much too surprised. honestly, this put things into perspective. i have been always worrying about the wrong stuff in my life, i got worked up for the wrong reasons, and now, i feel how i could have been so naive, so foolish, so blind.</p>

			<p class="center-align">cancer opened up a lot of opportunities for me to grow as a human being, and i'll be damned if i did not take all of it.</p>
